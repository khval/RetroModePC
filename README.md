# RetroModePC
RetroMode.library for PC (just stripped version)

This just 1 to 1 conversion of the files, 
no work has started do endianness issues

This is more like template for making a Linux ".a" library 
from AmigaOS4 retromode.library.

Work in progress: converting Amiga style code into Linux style code.

A common source code be ideal, but there will be problems with idltool used to generate the skeleton files on AmigaOS4.
